# Project Compressor
This repository contains the practice of compressing and decompressing files taken in PROP subject (2019-Q2, spring season).

We have made a programming project associated with the **life cycle of a computer application**, with emphasis on the implementation phase. We have applied the **Three-tier architecture** concepts to build this our project and we have developed it with **Java** programming language.

## Documentation 
The goal of this practice is to implement the main functionality of compression and decompression of files (text files, images and folders). Such compression can be done *with or without loss of information*. For this we apply the compression and decompression algorithms, which are **LZ78, LZW, LZSS, JPEG**. For more details look the folder called `doc`.  

To better understand the use of the application, look at the [User Manual](doc/ManualDeUsuario.pdf)

We also have generated the code documentation, which is **javadoc**, look the folder `javadoc` and open the file *index.html* on browser.
## Run the application
#### Windows
    Just click on the jar file
#### Linux
    Execute the following command line: >> java -jar compresor.jar

## Notes
In order to work correctly, the program will need to acces the following file
- Ayuda.json

Do not modify this file.
